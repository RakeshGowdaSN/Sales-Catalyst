## Key Technical Highlights

- **Catalyst Agent Orchestration:** Modular LLM agent (`agents/catalyst_agent.py`) orchestrates all core workflows: meeting briefing, product recommendation, competitor comparison, recap, invite/email creation, and technical Q&A.

- **Strict Workflow Automation:** Pre-meeting, in-meeting, and post-meeting flows are step-by-step and stateful.
- **Natural Language Interaction:** Friendly, concise, and always professionalâ€”never raw data or code.

## Layman-Friendly Explanation

Sales-Catalyst is like having a sharp, always-on sales coordinator. It prepares you for meetings, analyzes competitor info, recommends products from diagrams, and handles your post-meeting follow-ups. Just chat or share a photoâ€”Catalyst handles the rest, taking care of calendar invites and emails, too.

## Catalyst Agent Workflow (User Journey)

### Pre-Meeting Workflow
1. **Greeting:** Catalyst greets Alex professionally.
2. **Briefing:** On request, Catalyst fetches and summarizes a full meeting briefing (contacts, history, opportunity, painpoints).
3. **Visual Prompt:** Immediately prompts Alex to share additional technical details or diagrams.
4. **Visual Intake:** Waits for Alex to upload or share an image/diagram.

### Vision-to-RAG Workflow
5. **Image Analysis:** Catalyst analyzes shared image/diagram for customer needs and formulates a product search.
6. **Product Recommendation:** Calls product info tool, recommends the right product based on RAG search, and explains why based on the tool's returned info.
7. **Comparison Offer:** Proactively asks if Alex wants a competitor comparison.
8. **Comparison Delivery:** If confirmed, provides a concise, factual comparison.

### Post-Meeting Workflow
9. **Recap Initiation:** On "recap" request, asks Alex for notes or images.
10. **Recap Analysis:** Extracts and summarizes discussion points, action items, and follow-up date from shared notes/image.
11. **Recap Delivery:** Reads back the summary conversationally.
12. **Invite Creation:** Offers to create a calendar invite; if confirmed, creates and reports result based on tool output.
13. **Email Draft:** Offers to draft a follow-up email; if confirmed, creates and reports result.

### General Requests & Exits
- **Technical/Product Questions:** Answers using product info tools.
- **Graceful Exit:** Friendly, succinct sign-off when finished.

> At every step, the Catalyst agent always interprets tool outputs to natural language, never reveals raw data, and never deviates from the above workflows or order.
